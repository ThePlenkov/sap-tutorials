# ABAP Security Fundamentals

## Key Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
ABAP applications should implement multiple layers of security controls:
- Network security
- System security
- Application security
- Data security

### 2. Least Privilege
- Users should only have access to resources necessary for their tasks
- Avoid using SAP_ALL profile
- Implement granular authorization checks

### 3. Secure by Default
- Always start with restrictive settings
- Explicitly grant permissions rather than relying on defaults
- Validate all inputs
- Encrypt sensitive data

## Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Missing Authorization Checks**
```abap
" Insecure - No authorization check
METHOD display_salary.
  SELECT * FROM hrsal INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_salary).
  " Process salary data
ENDMETHOD.

" Secure - With authorization check
METHOD display_salary.
  AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'P_SALARY'
    ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '03'.
  IF sy-subrc <> 0.
    RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_no_authority.
  ENDIF.
  
  SELECT * FROM hrsal INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_salary).
  " Process salary data
ENDMETHOD.
```

2. **Hardcoded Credentials**
```abap
" Never do this
DATA: lv_password TYPE string VALUE 'MySecret123'.

" Instead, use secure storage solutions
DATA: lo_sec_storage TYPE REF TO cl_security_storage.
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use AUTHORITY-CHECK
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use secure configuration settings
4. Regular security testing
5. Keep ABAP systems updated
