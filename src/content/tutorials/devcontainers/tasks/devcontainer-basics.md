# DevContainer Fundamentals

Development Containers (DevContainers) provide a consistent, reproducible development environment for your projects.

## What are DevContainers?

DevContainers are development environments that run inside containers. They allow you to:
- Package your development tools and dependencies
- Share consistent environments across team members
- Isolate project dependencies
- Quickly onboard new team members

## Tools Supporting DevContainers

1. **IDEs and Editors**
   - Visual Studio Code with Remote - Containers extension
   - GitHub Codespaces
   - JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, etc.)
   - GitPod

2. **Features**
   - Integrated terminal
   - Debugging support
   - Extension installation inside container
   - Port forwarding
   - Volume mounting

## DevContainer Components

1. **Configuration Files**
   ```plaintext
   .devcontainer/
   ├── devcontainer.json    # Main configuration
   ├── Dockerfile          # Optional custom image
   └── docker-compose.yml  # Optional multi-container setup
   ```

2. **devcontainer.json Properties**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Project Development",
     "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
     "features": {
       "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {}
     },
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": [
           "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**
   - Same environment for all developers
   - Eliminates "works on my machine" issues
   - Version-controlled configuration

2. **Isolation**
   - Project-specific dependencies
   - No conflicts between projects
   - Clean development environment

3. **Onboarding**
   - Quick setup for new team members
   - Documented development requirements
   - Automated environment setup

4. **Flexibility**
   - Custom Dockerfile support
   - Multi-container environments
   - IDE independence

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Keep configurations in version control
   - Document any special requirements
   - Use specific versions for base images

2. **Performance**
   - Mount source code as volume
   - Use .dockerignore
   - Cache dependencies appropriately

3. **Security**
   - Avoid running as root
   - Keep base images updated
   - Review third-party features
